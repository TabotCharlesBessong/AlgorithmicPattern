### **The Problem Recap:**
Imagine aliens have their own alphabet order. You are given some words in this alien language and an "order" that shows how their letters are ranked.

We need to figure out if the list of words is sorted correctly according to the alien alphabet.

---

### **Example Walkthrough:**
Let's say:
- Words = `["hello", "leetcode"]`
- Order = `"hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"`

---

### **Step 1: Create a Map for the Order**
We need to remember where each letter belongs in the alien alphabet.

In the map:
- `'h'` is at position `0`
- `'l'` is at position `1`
- `'a'` is at position `2`
  
And so on...

The map looks like this:
```js
{
  h: 0, l: 1, a: 2, b: 3, c: 4, d: 5, e: 6, f: 7, g: 8,
  i: 9, j: 10, k: 11, m: 12, n: 13, o: 14, p: 15,
  q: 16, r: 17, s: 18, t: 19, u: 20, v: 21,
  w: 22, x: 23, y: 24, z: 25
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Compare Words**
We look at each pair of words to see if they're in the correct order.

#### **Compare "hello" and "leetcode"**
- Look at the first letter of each word:
  - `'h'` in `"hello"` is at position `0`
  - `'l'` in `"leetcode"` is at position `1`
  
Since `0 < 1`, `"hello"` is correctly before `"leetcode"`. ✅

---

### **Step 3: What Happens When Letters are the Same?**
If the letters are the same, like `"apple"` and `"app"`, we need to keep checking the next letters.

If one word is shorter but has all the same letters as the beginning of another word, the shorter word should come first.
  
For example:
- `"app"` should come before `"apple"`.

---

### **Step-by-Step Functioning of the Code**
Here's a simplified demonstration of how the code works:

1. **Create the order map:** 
   - Each letter is given its rank based on the alien alphabet.
  
2. **Loop through pairs of words:**
   - Compare `"hello"` and `"leetcode"`.
   - Since the first different letter (`'h'` vs. `'l'`) is in the correct order, continue to the next pair.
  
3. **If No Issues Found:**  
   - Return `true` because all words are in the correct order.

---

### **Code Function Step-by-Step**
Here’s a **step-by-step walkthrough with the JavaScript code**:
```javascript
var isAlienSorted = function(words, order) {
  // Step 1: Create a map of alien letter orders
  let orderMap = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < order.length; i++) {
    orderMap[order[i]] = i;
  }

  // Step 2: Compare each pair of words
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
    let word1 = words[i];
    let word2 = words[i + 1];

    // Step 3: Compare letters of the words
    for (let j = 0; j < Math.min(word1.length, word2.length); j++) {
      let char1 = word1[j];
      let char2 = word2[j];

      // Step 4: Check if characters are different
      if (char1 !== char2) {
        if (orderMap[char1] > orderMap[char2]) {
          return false; // Words are out of order
        }
        break;
      }
    }

    // Step 5: Check if word2 is a prefix of word1 (e.g., "apple" vs "app")
    if (word1.length > word2.length && word1.startsWith(word2)) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
};
```

### **Example Walkthrough Using a 3-Word List**
Words: `["app", "apple", "banana"]`  
Order: `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`

1. Compare `"app"` and `"apple"`:
   - Both start with `"app"`.
   - `"app"` is shorter than `"apple"`, so it's in the correct order. ✅

2. Compare `"apple"` and `"banana"`:
   - First letters: `"a"` and `"b"`.
   - Since `"a"` comes before `"b"`, this pair is in the correct order. ✅

---

### **Final Output:**  
If all pairs pass the checks, the function returns `true`. If any pair is out of order, it returns `false`.
